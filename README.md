### Project Description
This project focuses on developing a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize seller data from an e-commerce platform. The objective is to create a comprehensive tool that provides insights into seller performance, product distribution, and customer ratings, both overall and segmented by demographics. The project leverages Power BI’s powerful data visualization and analytical capabilities to transform raw data into actionable insights.

### Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes a range of attributes related to sellers, products, and ratings. Key columns in the dataset are:

Date Added: The date when the data was recorded.
Category: The product category (e.g., Garden, Kitchen).
Seller Link: Hyperlink to the seller’s page.
Seller Storefront URL: URL of the seller's storefront.
Seller Product Count: Number of products listed by the seller.
Seller Ratings: Ratings given to the seller by customers.
Seller Details: Contact and business details of the seller.
Seller Business Name: Name of the seller’s business.
Business Address: Address of the seller’s business.
Count of Seller Brands: Number of different brands the seller offers.
Max % of Negative Seller Ratings: Percentage of negative ratings for various time periods (30 days, 90 days, 12 months).
Hero Product Ratings: Ratings for the top hero products.
Sample Brand Name: Example of a brand offered by the seller.
Sample Brand URL: URL to the sample brand's page.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data cleaning and transformation are performed directly within Power BI using the Power Query Editor. The following steps are undertaken:

Column Removal: Eliminate unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
Handling Missing Values: Address gaps and inconsistencies in the data.
Data Type Correction: Ensure all columns are in the appropriate format for accurate analysis.
Data Standardization: Harmonize data formats and values for consistency.
### Dashboard Design
The Power BI dashboard is structured as :

###### 1. Overall Analysis Page
This page provides a high-level overview of key metrics and trends:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Average Rating %: Displays the average rating percentage across all sellers.
Number of Countries: Shows the count of countries represented by the sellers.
Seller Count: Total number of sellers.
Total Products: Aggregate count of products listed.
Charts and Visualizations:
Bar Chart: Illustrates the count of seller brands for each seller.
Pie Chart: Represents the distribution of brands across different sellers.
Line Chart: Tracks the trend of ratings over time.
Treemap: Visualizes the distribution of seller brands in a hierarchical manner.

### Tools and Techniques
Power BI: Used for building and managing the dashboard, creating interactive visualizations, and integrating data.
Power Query Editor: Utilized for cleaning and transforming data before visualization.
### Key Features
Interactive Visualizations: Allows users to interact with and explore data through various charts and graphs.
Dynamic Filtering: Provides the ability to filter and drill down into specific data segments.
Real-Time Data Updates: Ensures the dashboard reflects the most current data available.
### Future Work
Potential enhancements to the project include:
Integration with Additional Data Sources: Expanding the analysis by incorporating more datasets.
Advanced Analytics: Applying predictive modeling and machine learning techniques for deeper insights.
